# NP Sprite sheet
A simple addon I use to animate in Krita and export the sprite sheet. It maps each layer to a separate animation, and non-animated layers to a single-framed animation.
The distinguishing feature is exporting a JSON file describing the animations.

To use: install in the pykrita folder, and copy np_sprite_sheet.desktop into the directory.
