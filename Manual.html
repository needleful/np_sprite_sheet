<h1>NP Sprite Sheet</h1>
Convert animations to sprite sheets easily!
<h3>Usage</h3>
Create different animations as separate layers.<br/>
Then, press "export" and choose where to save the file.<br/>
The plugin will export to where you've chosen and save "[filename].ss.json" along with it.<br/>
The JSON file describes each animation for loading into other programs.
It contains the following data:
<ul>
	<li>anims: an object mapping the names of each animation to objects with these values:
		<ul>
			<li>offset: the starting frame, going left to right, top to bottom. The frames of the animation are in sequential order. </li>
			<li>key_times: the number of frames to hold each keyframe until switching to the next. <br/><em>Important note:</em> the last frame will only be held for 1 frame, as the size of an animation is determine per document, not per layer, and can't be used to determine the correct value. To hold the final frame longer, add "+X" to the end of the layer's name, replacing "X" with the amount of holding frames to add.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>framerate: the frames per second as an integer</li>
	<li>size: the number of rows, then columns</li>
</ul>
